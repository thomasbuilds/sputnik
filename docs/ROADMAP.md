## Media (current state)

- [x] Show a note's images and videos side by side in a row that scrolls sideways
- [x] Swipe between the images in a note in the viewer
- [x] Save an image or copy its link from the viewer

- [ ] Test media on Android (the video lockdown options, the prebuilt `media_kit` libraries, saving to the gallery)
- [ ] Check the hash rule against real hosts (e.g. nostr.build) so no existing notes break
- [x] Load profile pictures and banners with the same size cap, redirect, and hash rules (HTTPS only)
- [x] Load profile pictures and banners only once you turn it on (off by default)
